        I chose data for that related to dogs. I saw this data set about dog names and knew it was the one. The data is also available as a CSV file, so I knew it was the data I wanted to use. I downloaded the file as an excel spreadsheet so I could interact with the information. My main questions about the dogs were about their names and their birthdays. 
My Hypothesis:
What is the ratio of male dogs to female dogs?
How many dogs are named Tigger, Coco, Lola, Chewbacca, Zoe, Claire, Blanche, and Callie?
What is the average birth year of all the dogs?
What is the birth year of the oldest dog?
I was curious about the occurrences of those specific names, so I checked to see how many occurrences of each name there were. I did this by checking the data containing the dogs’ names, a total of 508196 names, and checking every time that name was found. The names I checked for were Tigger, Coco, Lola, Chewbacca, Zoe, Claire, Blanche, and Callie. I also wanted to know what the ratio of female to male dogs was. The sex of the dog in the spreadsheet is represented by M for male or F for female. I created a new column that showed a 1 whenever there was a M in the row. The sum of the created column showed the total number of males. The total number of dogs minus the number of males revealed the total number of females. I wanted to know the average birthyear of the dogs. I did that by finding the sum of the birth years for all the dogs and then dividing by the total number of dogs. I also wanted to know the oldest dog’s age. I did this by finding the minimum datum in the row of dog birth dates. Most of the Excel formulas I already knew, but the ones I did not know how to do I researched. 
All of the data and resources used in this project I uploaded onto Github. I have had previous experience with Github so the creation of a new repository was not hard. I created a new repository and created a README as well as multiple files organized into understandable structure.
